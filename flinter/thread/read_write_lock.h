/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 * Read-write lock is a "share reading and exclusive writing" lock. It allows
 * multiple readers to access data simultaneously, or only one writer to access
 * data exclusively, but not both.
 *
 * That is to say the writer can safely modify data before it unlocks the
 * read-write lock, until then can other accessors get unblocked. If there are
 * already readers accessing data, all writers should block.
 *
 * Non recursive, writer first.
